CvC Probability is computed using Mapper - Reducer through Hadoop.

Batsman vs Bowler data along with their clusters is uploaded to HDFS and MR is used to compute 'cvcstat'.

We use 'cvcstat' to compute Cluster vs Cluster probabilites.

We calculate Player vs Player probabilities by using Player vs Player data.
